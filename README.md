# Port of Robert Sedgewick's Java Algorithms Library to C++
The code contained here is my port of the Java code (http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)
in Robert Sedgewick's Java algorithms library to C++.

Motivation:
- There are a number of algorithms books for C++ but I do not feel that they
  are quite as clear as Sedgewick's 4th edition Java book
- Many, including Sedgewick's previous C++ edition, use an outdated subset
  of C++ that adds to the lack of clarity
- I wanted to learn through doing

This is a work in progress and there are a lot of tests to add and many todos.

There is some additional code that includes modernizations of the source code
in Sedgewick's "Algorithms in C++" Volumes 1-5. All of this code needs more work.
There are also a handful of extras that I would like to add as "nice to haves".

This library is (or will be) dependent on Boost, Qt, and the GSL.
