- Acyclic_lp has issues
- use only key/value pointers in symbol tables
- fix binary search tree
- remove all unnecessary using declarations from node based structures
- check if other trees are missing public delete and use remove for each
- red black bst has pointer access issues (nullptr being read in is_red)
- need to handle the empty string case for key comparators separately
- using a lambda with decltype as a comparator returns no matching constructor, need to handle both cases
- Std_in may still be passing empty strings in
- comparator still has issues, may not be setting key everywhere
- B_tree needs more work
- fix overload resolution issues in Insertion_sort
- review all "effective" guidelines and make code follow them
  e.g. make comparators (std::less) return false for ==
- convert all possible classes (with only static members etc) to namespaces (i.e. sorts)
- LSD_radix_sort has a bug that duplicates strings into the output vector
- fix Mergesort_x
- remove unnecessary comments
- review all uses of static and make sure they are necessary
- fix whitefilter after In is completed
- fix or make consistent all comparators, std::less, less, compareTo, etc
- fix imports between headers and .cpp when imports are in headers
- make sure all sort mains use a show and that all shows use range based for loop
- put all code in a global namespace
- any operations on the iterators in Min_pq and Max_pq may invalidate
  the size member, fix this
- use the ternary operator to check for nullptr where possible
```
std::string tmp(tmpPtrVal ? tmpPtrVal : "");
```
- use weak_ptr to return ptrs in structures
- be sure to fix usage of atoi -> per CERT security docs
- delete unnecessary iterators from node structures
- review locations where In and Out are used and replace replacements
- replace hashCode anywhere with std::hash overload
- move all tests/unitTest/checks to separate files and use catch or google test
- convert Std_in readAll to return one long string
- come back to Linked_bag, stack, queue etc
- make the I/O classes look more like std streams
- add iterators to all classes missing iterators
- move constants in Trie's to Trie class and make friend classes
- add overloads for ctors in In etc that take strings to take const char *
- add Stroustrup's args to vector utility function and process all argv with that
- double check all checks of argc
- add ostream << support to Point_2d
- add ostream support to Date
- Digraph generator Edge needs to be fixed
- check math_errorhandling and handle errno/MATH_ERRNO after cmath calls
- fix up str_to_num issues
- need Bipartite_x
- remove unnecessary container ctors where default ctor would be called
- fix null in Bellman_ford
- need to make a decision on where to use pointers and other options and
  be consistent (boost::optional)
- check Java Binary out/in etc for consistent IO format
- remove utility stream swap for swap member function
- need dtors in all node structures
- Binomial_min_pq iterator needs more work
- Boruvka_mst needs some fixes
- replace all old style for loops with iterators and range for loops where possible
- fix Stack, Queue, Etc and add const to all references that can be const
- Dijkstra_sp/undirected needs work
- fix iterator deal in Directed_eulerian_path and Directed_eulerian_cycle
- fix Doubling_ratio and Std_random::uniform(int, int) issues
- fix range for loops in Edge_weighted_graph
- fix up index_file
- fix up Adj_matrix_edge_weighted_digraph
- fix up Floyd_warshall
- declare in class definitions of operator== and operator!= friend
