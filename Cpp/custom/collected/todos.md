- Acyclic_lp has issues
- use only key/value pointers in symbol tables
- fix binary search tree
- remove all unnecessary using declarations from node based structures
- check if other trees are missing public delete and use remove for each
- red black bst has pointer access issues (nullptr being read in is_red)
- need to handle the empty string case for key comparators separately
- using a lambda with decltype as a comparator returns no matching constructor, need to handle both cases
- Std_in may still be passing empty strings in
- comparator still has issues, may not be setting key everywhere
