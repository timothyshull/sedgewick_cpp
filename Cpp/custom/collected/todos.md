- Acyclic_lp has issues
- use only key/value pointers in symbol tables
- fix binary search tree
- remove all unnecessary using declarations from node based structures
- check if other trees are missing public delete and use remove for each
- red black bst has pointer access issues (nullptr being read in is_red)
- need to handle the empty string case for key comparators separately
- using a lambda with decltype as a comparator returns no matching constructor, need to handle both cases
- Std_in may still be passing empty strings in
- comparator still has issues, may not be setting key everywhere
- B_tree needs more work
- fix overload resolution issues in Insertion_sort
- review all "effective" guidelines and make code follow them
  e.g. make comparators (std::less) return false for ==
- convert all possible classes (with only static members etc) to namespaces (i.e. sorts)
- LSD_radix_sort has a bug that duplicates strings into the output vector
- fix Mergesort_x
- remove unnecessary comments
- review all uses of static and make sure they are necessary
- fix whitefilter after In is completed
- fix or make consistent all comparators, std::less, less, compareTo, etc
- fix imports between headers and .cpp when imports are in headers
- make sure all sort mains use a show and that all shows use range based for loop
